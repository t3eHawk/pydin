PyDin
=====

PyDin is a Python ETL framework that allows you to develop, setup and maintain
ETL processes.

This module was originally a simple standalone script on a small server to run
a dozen of jobs.

But with a growth of our project we understood that there is nothing in public
repositories that will cover all our requierments without significant
workarounds.
So we just decided that this script must evolve together with a project and
must become something else.

PyDin follows certain ETL phisolophy that was born in our own expirience.
It was created to work in real production environment with thoushands of
daily jobs.

Framework includes serveral elements that makes creation of ETL processes with
Python more convinient.
But it is always up to you whether to use standard approaches promoted by us
or not. If not - it is ok because module gives you possibility to redefine
almost all main elements. That is what makes it a framework and not a regular
module.

This document will be updated as soon as possible to provide all necessary
details for final users.
